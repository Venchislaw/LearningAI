# Unsupervised Learning

2024-06-19
Today I'm studying Unsupervised Learning:
Feelings: Nice

___
Notes start:

### Unsupervised Learning
- Clustering
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Anomaly Detection

Topics covered:
**PCA**
**T-SNE**
**K Means**

___
## PCA

PCA is used for reduction of highly correlated features.
It basicaly asks a question:
> Can we use 1 feature $z$ instead of 2 features $x$ and $y$?

Poorly chosen axis for projection results lower data variance.

**Maximize Variance**
or
**Minimize SE**
(it's the same)









Random Goofy ahh notes:
T-SNE is also a dimensionality reduction technique used for visualization.
